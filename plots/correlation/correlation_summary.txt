All plots related to correlation are saved in the folder plots/correlation

Looking at correlation against price, we don't find very strong correlations.
The highest one being with bedroomCount 0.37.

If we split the data between houses and apartments, we find stronger correlations:
- For Houses, the correlation with bedroomCount (0.37) is lower than with toiletCount (0.47).
- For Apartments, the correlation with bedroomCount (0.33) is lower than with bathroomCount (0.50).

Looking at other variables correlation, we still have no strong correlations
but when we split the data:
- For Houses, the correlation between bedroomCount and toiletCount is 0.63.
- For Apartments, the correlation between bedroomCount and bathroomCount is 0.66.

Another interesting aspect is the almost null correlation between price and parking variables (-0.00).
If we combine indoor and outdoor parking, then the correlation with price increases to 0.01
Which still is very low.

For our model, we may think about combining bathroom and toilet counts
